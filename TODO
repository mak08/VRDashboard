FIX: Index polars by polar id, not race id
ADD: Button to clear the raw messages

# fixed - proper E/W indicator
# fixed - Check for zero DeltaT data
# done - Convert to page action
# close window - but won't attach when restoring tabs on browser restart. browserAtion also won't
# done - Add table with status for all races.
- Then add funny things to it like penalties and bad sails and barrel status and programmer ...

- Error handling - race list at startup, check for stale positionsa
# done - Handle Auth and rank messages. Reset races on user change

#add race by id and show alert- Handle unknown races (relaod list?)
- Send current heading/TWA to router so it can deal with the penalty 
(but not sure the router deals ok) 
- send available options to the (beta) races. Also userid to keep track who's who.

Michael:
# done - The 'Last command' columns is not filled yet; I'm not sure what is the best way to display them (if we want them at all).
# done - Last Command: handle prog commands
# done - Race rank should be included
# done - The single status line should be removed.

# done -vT - Remove or implement the vC column (supposed to show Computed speed 
# according to options, wind and polars reported in the game)
- Select boat to get routing for (so you could track your other
   boats without switching accounts - or spy on your opponents...)

- Handle player card in general, even our own - it's a way to refresh position sooner.
