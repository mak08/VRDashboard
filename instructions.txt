1) Install the extension
2) Go to the game home page
3) Click the Z extension icon in the toolbar
4) DO NOT close the debugger warning banner
5) Enter a race to force update of boat position
6) Wait few minutes to get the second table populated with new data

How to deal with the debugging banner:

It can be disabled, but that may not be good idea from privacy/security standpoint.
Not because we'll steal your data, but because some other extension you install could do it
Ideally tou should be running second Chrome instance (or Opera with "Download Chrome Extension" installed)
and only disable the warning there.

To disable the warning go to chrome://flags/#silent-debugger-extension-api
